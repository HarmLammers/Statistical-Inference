### Introduction

This is a project to deal with the problem i no longer have:
i can't get RStudio to include the results of the R code into the knitted document.

Proved to be that the r-code was included in brackets without the r reference:
so i used labels ```{introduction} instead of ```{r introduction}  

Small errors and big effects :-(

Good luck to you all!!
